# Burger Devouring App

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

A heroku deployed application that allows a user to create a burger logger that uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a homemade ORM following a Model View Controller design pattern. 

Users input their desired burger and it will pop up in the left column to be able to get devoured and move to the right columb which can then be clicked to be removed. 

Anything that a user is typed into the main input box is created within the database to be saved.

Inside the config folder, a homemade orm is designed to be able to communicate with the burger model and controller to handle any query that is being commanded by the user and relay information and display output appropriately.
